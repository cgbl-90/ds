18:17:08.736  ✖ Found only one commit
              This typically means you have ran into one of the following scenarios:
              - You've checked out a shallow copy of the Git repository, which some CI systems do by default.
                In order for Chromatic to correctly determine baseline commits, we need access to the full Git history graph.
                Refer to your CI provider's documentation for details.
              - You've only made a single commit so far.  
                Please make at least one additional commit in order for Chromatic to be able to detect what's changed.
