    # What is a Design System?

    A design system is a comprehensive guide that defines the visual and functional aspects of a product's interface. It includes reusable components, design tokens, guidelines, and documentation to ensure consistency across all products and platforms.

    # What is Storybook?

    Storybook is an open-source tool that enables developers to build and test UI components in isolation. It allows you to create, document, and visually test components, making it easier to develop and maintain a design system.

    # About Carmen L.

    I've been working in the tech industry for over 10 years, mostly in customer-facing roles. As a frontend developer, I focus on creating customer-centric experiences, with an emphasis on React & Visual Testing.

    Previously, I worked in various roles including customer support agent, customer support lead, customer success manager, and regional/country manager in e-Commerce, SaaS, and Gaming companies. I've had the pleasure of working with great clients like TED Talks, Aetna, NSU Florida, NASA, Harvard, Typeform, and others.

    Outside of work, I'm passionate about empowering women in tech through mentorship, focused on training effective communication at Toastmasters, and committed to exploring diverse viewpoints through travel. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Customer Experience Innovation at UNIR.
